Notes for Design and Analysis of Algorithms

These are my public notes for CMSC451.
Notes are taken using Obsidian.md and based off of lectures by Laxman Dhulipala.

Figures are either made by me, taken from [David Mount's CMSC420 notes](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2022/cmsc420-0201/Lects/cmsc420-fall2022-lects.pdf) or from the [CMU notes](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15451-s16/) Prof. Dhulipala lectures from.
